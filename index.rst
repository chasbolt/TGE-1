Techniques of Geoscientific Experimentation (TGE) is a resource designed to help
scientists, hobbyists, and experimentalists learn how to develop their own
experimental equipment. Topics include mechanical design, data acquisition,
electronics, microcontrollers, CAD, pressure vessel design, and more.

This course material has been primarily developed by John Leeman and Chris
Marone. The format and online format of the course are patterned after the
excellent course structure developed by researchers and students at the
University of British Columbia. Their courses are available on  `geosci.xyz
<http://geosci.xyz>`_. We encourage others to use the material with proper
citation. Contributions are welcome and encouraged - the material improves
though repeated use! Join the development on github_.
